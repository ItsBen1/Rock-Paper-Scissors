# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a quick rock, paper, scissors game I had created using C#. Very simple and a great warm up project. I used visual studio communtity 2019 to create the draft so it may not work as intended without the application. This was a test to understand the process of posting on github. I will put the code in a comment under the post just in case it isn't working.
